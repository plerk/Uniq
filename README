Uniq is a pure perl module. It exports the following modules.

    Method name			Uniq shell equivalant
    uniq			uniq
    dups			uniq -d
    distinct			uniq -u


For those who do not familiar with unix shells, here is more verbose
explanation.

    uniq	Eliminates multiple occurances of values from input.
    dups	Reports what values appear more than once in input.
    distinct	Reprts only those values that are not duplicated.

    If your input is say @list = qw ( 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5 );
    uniq @list returns a list ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
    dups @list returns a list ( 2, 4 )
    and 
    distinct @list returns a list (1,3,5)
